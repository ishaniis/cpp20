    In this tut43, we would explore different types of containers:

    1. Sequential Containers:
    1.1 Stores data in a linear fashion
    1.2 Elements to be added either added in the beginning or in the ending 
    1.3 Example: Vector
    1.3.1 Vectors:
    1.3.1.1 Faster Random Access
    1.3.1.2 Slower Insertion and Deletion
    1.3.1.3 Faster Insertion (At End)

    2. Associative Containers:
    2.1 Associative containers are designed such that enhances the way accessing some elements in that container
    2.2 Fastest and user friendly way to reach out to some elements in a given container. 
    2.3 Example: Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap etc. 
    2.4 In asociative containers, except random access, all the operations are FASTER, but we cannout jump into conclusion as to which operation is faster or slower. 
    

    3. Derived Containers:
    3.1 Derived from either the sequence or the associative containers. 
    3.2 Real Life modelling 
    3.3 Examples: Stack, Queue, Priority Queue etc. 

    3.3.1 Stack: LIFO (Last In, First Out)
    3.3.2 Queue: FIFO (First In, First Out)
    3.3.3 Lists:
    3.3.3.1 Random Access is Slow
    3.3.3.2 Insertion and deletion at any position is relatively faster, because they only use pointers
